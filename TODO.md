# TODO

+ edit "why react"


+ Breaking an app into CommonJS modules.
+ Bundling modules into a single file with Browserify.




NOTE: assets must be relative path for GitHub pages to work.

+ add the actual "good" HTML boilerplate to the `init` mission.

# Extra

http://material-ui.com uses the JS StyleSheet approach, also quite interesting.
