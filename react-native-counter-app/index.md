# Same Same But Different, Cross-Platform ReactNative

In this lesson we are going to build a timer app, and make it run on both iOS and Android.

Although it's possible to share 100% of the code between your iOS and Android apps, making them exactly the same is usually not the best way to optimize user experience for diehard iOS or Android fans.

While code sharing is a great advantage, another less obvious advantage of ReactNative is how easy it is to build _platform-specific_ apps! The goal is not "write once, run everywhere", but to build apps that feel native to users.

As you build the timer app, you will:

+ View, Text, Image. The fundamental building blocks of React Native.
+ Use flex to implement an adaptive layout that works for different screen sizes and orientations.

Note: ReactNative Android newer than ReactNative iOS, and you should expect to encounter bugs. If you run into weird problems, search [ReactNative Android Issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/labels/Android) to see if its a bug. In general, get iOS to work first, then pray that it works on Android.
